# Train a Natural Language Classifier to categorize a message as SPAM or HAM

We will build a classifier on IBM Cloud and Watson Studio that classifies an incoming message as HAM or SPAM. The steps will include

1. Prepare and prepress labelled data

2. Create the model in IBM Studio and deploy it

3. Use the model in a Jupypter Notebook

Pre-requisites - Curious minds and your laptop to program on! Beginner developers are welcome!
